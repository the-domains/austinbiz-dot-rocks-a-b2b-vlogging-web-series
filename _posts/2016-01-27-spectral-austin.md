description: 'Three summer days and three summer nights in Austin. "Spectral Austin" was shot in the summer of 2013 as my second solo timelapse and hyperlapse project. My goal was to present the city by both day and night, showing the perpetual beauty of our bustling hill country capital during my favorite season of the year.'
